# ModelBatch Implementation Summary

*Status as of January 2025*

## 🎯 Project Overview
ModelBatch is a library for training hundreds to thousands of independent PyTorch models simultaneously on a single GPU using `torch.vmap` for vectorized operations. This enables efficient hyperparameter sweeps and maximizes GPU utilization.

## ⚠️ Current Status: Active Development

**ModelBatch is kind of functional but has known issues that need resolution:**

### Test Status
- **Training Equivalence**: Divergence between sequential and batched training --- so training model with ModelBatch does not give the same results as training the same model sequentially
- **LSTM/Custom Model Support**: Limited due to `torch.vmap` batching rule limitations
- **Performance**: 6.3x-10.4x speedup achieved

### Known Issues
1. **LSTM Models**: `RuntimeError: Batching rule not implemented for aten::lstm.input`
2. **CNN Models**: Assertion failures in gradient calculation
3. **Training Equivalence**: Max differences of 3-16% vs sequential training

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Architecture (70% Complete)
- **`ModelBatch` Class**: Main nn.Module for vectorized model batching
  - Parameter stacking with `torch.func.stack_module_state` ✅
  - Model compatibility validation ✅
  - Per-model loss computation ✅
  - Save/load functionality ✅
  - Metrics tracking ✅
  - **Forward pass with torch.vmap** ✅ (working for compatible models)

### Supporting Components (50% Complete)
- **`OptimizerFactory`**: Per-model parameter groups with different learning rates ✅
- **`DataRouter`**: Data filtering and stratification for models ✅
- **`CallbackPack`**: Monitoring, logging, and NaN detection ✅
- **Utility Functions**: Training loops, evaluation, model creation ✅

### Integration Ready
- **W&B Callback**: Weights & Biases integration ✅
- **TensorBoard Callback**: TensorBoard logging ✅
- **AMP Support**: Automatic Mixed Precision with GradScaler ✅

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: 19 failed, 36 passed (34.5% failure rate) ⚠️
- **Package Structure**: Professional layout with proper imports ✅
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings ✅
- **Code Quality**: ~800 lines of clean, modular code ✅

## ⚠️ Technical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. LSTM/RNN Model Support
- **Problem**: `torch.vmap` doesn't support `aten::lstm.input` operations
- **Impact**: LSTM models cannot be batched
- **Status**: Need to investigate alternative approaches or workarounds

### 2. Training Equivalence Issues
- **Problem**: Batched training shows 1-16% accuracy differences vs sequential
- **Examples**: 
  - Quick consistency test: 16% max difference
  - CIFAR10 benchmark: 3-8.67% differences
- **Root Cause**: Investigating numerical precision and gradient flow differences
- **Status**: Need to understand and resolve divergence

### 3. CNN Model Test Failures
- **Problem**: Assertion failures in custom CNN model tests
- **Impact**: Limited CNN architecture support
- **Status**: Need to debug and fix test assertions

### Future Development (M3-M6)
- **M3**: HuggingFace integration for transformer models
- **M4**: Advanced data routing strategies
- **M5**: Distributed training support
- **M6**: Production deployment features

### Usage Commands

- **Run Tests**: `uv run -m pytest` (currently showing failures)
- **Install Dependencies**: `uv add --dev <package>`

The ModelBatch implementation is somewhatfunctional but requires resolution of test failures and training equivalence issues before being production-ready. The core architecture is sound, but model compatibility and numerical precision issues need to be addressed.
